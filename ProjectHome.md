## Short description: ##

This is a KISS network monitor (shows how much bandwidth you are taking on a daily basis) that I wrote after being frustrated to find no good open-source BM that works under both windows and linux. I built this since I am sometimes under strict restriction of bandwidth (university campus for example).

The frustrating thing about this program (comes from using pcap lib) is that WinPcap has to be installed in windows in order to work and it needs to be run as root in Unix.

The project works under both Windows and Linux. -Should- work under MacOS but I can't be sure (I don't own a Mac).

I am developing this project by myself but if **you** want to contribute feel free to ask me to join the project.
